              This Operation has closed (due to either an Operator-induced change or flight

              This Operation is executing a contingency action, either because it has been

              The USS requests the operator to replan the operation.  The reason could be either A) that USS received a constraint update from another USS or B) an update of contingent operation from another USS that overlaps with the operation, see reason field for the discription.  The operator is required to replan the operation to avoid the conflict.

            The violation type refers to the constriant type of violation, e.g. OPERATION
            or CONSTRANIT.  The constraining_id is the UUID associated with each constraint;
            When applicable, violating_volumes indicates the ordinals of volumes that are in
            violation. This allows for querying UTM for more information details.
