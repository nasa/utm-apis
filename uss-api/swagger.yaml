        Announce an Operation to another USS, either initial Operation or an
        update to the Operation. The Operation's owner creates the ID.

        This is the ENHANCED version of the nominal /operations/{gufi} endpoint.
        A USS receiving an operation on this endpoint MUST validate that PriorityElements.status == PUBLIC_SAFETY with an appropriate severity.

        In the future there may be several use cases for the this endpoint.
        Currently a single use case is required to be supported by USSs.

        ## Writing a public safety operation

        Public safety operations can only be operated by authorized agencies.  The
        identitiy management of those agencies and individuals within them will
        have more requirements than are levied on nominal USSs.  Thus the ability
        to manage those operations is limited to USSs that undergo additional
        checkout processes.  Successful completion of those processes allows for
        a USS to earn an additional Role (USS_PUBLIC_SAFETY) within UTM managing
        public safety ops.

        This role provides access to additional scopes, including utm.nasa.gov_write.publicsafety
        which is required to write to this endpoint.

        A public safety operation that ceases to be a public safety operation
        should CLOSE the operation as announced on this endpoint after creating
        a non-public safety operation on the nominal endpoint.  Note this means
        that the operation would be already be in the air when becoming a "new"
        nominal operation.  In addition, there will be a period of time during
        which this operation will have 2 GUFIs and 2 plans. The USS should aid
        the operator in minimizing this period of time (ideally to less than, say,
        10 seconds).  This approach ensures that all operations announced on this
        PUT endpoint have the same PriorityElement requirements.

        A nominal operation that becomes a public safety operation should
        follow a similar procedure as above.  CLOSE the nominal operation after
        announcing a new public safety operation on this endpoint.
