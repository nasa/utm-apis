  For GETTERs with query parameters, the parameter names must be lower case, however
  string parmeter values are case insensitive.


  Example of the GET-list using time window:

      /messages/?sent_time_after=2038-01-01T07:58:20.000Z&sent_time_before=2038-01-01T07:58:30.000Z


  (todo) GET-list for Positions is not yet in.

  (todo) GET-list returns an empty list if nothing is found.
  GET-by-gufi returns 404 if the item is not found."
