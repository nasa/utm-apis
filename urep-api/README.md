# UAS Report (UREP)
UREP is similar in function to a Pilot Weather Report (PIREP) or Position Reports (AIREP) 
in the National Airspace System (NAS).  UREPs are data that are provided to the UAS Traffic Management (UTM) System (see UTM description below) that can be shared with other stakeholders to provide better situational awareness.  While a traditional PIREP is typically confined to weather phenomena, a UREP allows for reporting of weather phenomena as well as other observable airspace activity (i.e., other aviation operations that could affect UTM operations).  
Since the UTM System is highly automated, the submission and retrieval of UREPs is built to rely on automated processes.
