    This file contains the core UTM models as OpenAPI 2.0 compliant definitions.

    Some key caveats when using/referencing this API:
      1. The API on its own is insufficeint to develop a USS or other UTM
      component.  For example, the USS Specification is needed to understand
      how and when to use the various endpoints and provides more details on
      security features that cannot be captured in the API docs.
      2. There is not a unified time synchronization approach in UTM currently.
      As such, times provided from one server MUST NOT be validated against each other.
      For example, if a sending server states that a data element
      was sent at 10:00:23, but the receiving server thinks it is currently
      10:00:22, the receiving server must not reject the data submission.  As
      we develop and roll out the time synchronization scheme for the USS
      Network, we will add appropriate validation requirements to the API
      documentation.
      3. On the contrary, times must be validated for consistency within a
      given data submission.  For example, if a server states that it sends
      a data instance at 10:00:23 and one of the other data elements states
      that a measurement was performed at 10:00:24, then the receiving server
      must reject that data submission. Some of these checks are explictly
      stated in the descriptions below. If you recognize any such checks that
      are not documented, please submit an issue report on github.
      4. These token SUBJECT validations are required for security.
      For PUT Operation to modify an existing operation, the token SUBJECT claim upon modification MUST equal the token SUBJECT claim for the initial Operation.
      For PUT Message associated with an Operation gufi, the token SUBJECT claim used for PUT Message MUST equal the token SUBJECT claim for the initial operation.
        This check is performed if the initial operation exists, so as to not preclude receiving emergency messages.
      For PUT Position associated with an Operation gufi, the token SUBJECT claim used for PUT Position MUST equal the token SUBJECT claim for the initial operation.
        This check is performed only if the initial operation exists, so as to not preclude receiving emergency position reports.

  timestamp:
    description: >-
      Timestamps MUST follow the guidance set forth in RFC3339.
      This RFC defines a profile for ISO8601 forcused on interoperability of Internet
      based systems.  This profile makes certain design decisions based on
      reducing rarely used options, elimination of redundant information, and
      overall simplicity.

      From these goals and insight from building interoperable systems,
      RFC3339 provides a grammar for timestamps.  Please see

      https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.6

      for that grammer and the sections preceding that grammar for more
      detailed discussion.

      For UTM, we have attempted to reduce the grammar to a regular expression,
      but this does not take into account all rules.  For example, a valid
      timestamp should not allow 30 days in February, but this is not in the
      regular expression.  Likewise, leap years are not captured in the
      regular expression.  Thus it is possible for a timestamp to satisfy this
      RE, but still not be valid and, thus, be rejected by some components of
      UTM.

      Note that this UTM format specifies millisecond precision for all
      time stamps.  This is why the min and max length are fixed at 24.

      Note that this UTM format specifies UTC time indicated by a trailing 'Z'.

      Note taht this UTM format specifies date and time separation with a 'T'.

    example: "2015-08-20T14:11:56.118Z"
  uuid:
    description: >-
      Currently, this is a UUID version 4.  These UUIDs have a well-defined
      regular expression.  However, beyond meeting the regular expression,
      there is an expectation that the numbers are generated appropriately
      in terms of the approach to psuedo-random number generation.  More
      details in the USS Specification document in this regard.

      UUIDs are used in several models and serve as primary keys in many cases.

      In all cases, unless otherwised specified, UUIDs are generated by a
      USS (or FIMS) prior to sending to another USS (or FIMS). Thus one
      entity does not add data elements (like a UUID primary key) to data
      originating from another entity.

      If ordering or sorting is required, the sort order is lexicographic as
      defined in RFC4122:

      UUIDs, as defined in this document, can also be ordered
      lexicographically.  For a pair of UUIDs, the first one follows the
      second if the most significant field in which the UUIDs differ is
      greater for the first UUID.  The second precedes the first if the
      most significant field in which the UUIDs differ is greater for
      the second UUID.

      Each value of the enum implies AT LEAST the accessibility of the previous
      value.  With the ordering:

        PUBLIC <= OPERATIONAL <= SAFETY <= SPECIAL

      The most restrictive value possible will be chosen for each data member
      while still meeting overall objectives of the system. Finding the correct
      values will likely be an on-going process. The values will be a first
      cut in the research platform version of UTM.

      The server receiving a request for data will need to filter the results
      based on the authorization presented by the requesting server.  Further
      details to be developed later.

  severity:
    description: >-
      The severity level of a UTMMessage. This severity labeling may be used by
      other components within UTM as well.  The labels are ordered such that
      they may be given priority handling by software systems and human users.
      **EMERGENCY > ALERT > CRITICAL > WARNING > NOTICE > INFORMATIONAL**
      In relation to a UTMMessage, the severities may be interpreted as follows.
      1. **EMERGENCY**
        There is an *immediate* impact to the safety of other air operations,
        the safety of people, or the safety of structures on the ground.
        Actions to mitigate required by other operations.
      2. **ALERT**
        There may be an impact to the safety of other air operations, the
        safety of people, or the safety of structures on the ground. Actions to
        mitigate required by other operations.
      3. **CRITICAL**
        Without mitigations by the affected operation, the situation may rise to
         an emergency in the near future.
      4. **WARNING**
        There is a contained issue that may result in the loss of aircraft. No
        immediate or likely effect to other operations, people on the ground,
        or structures.
      5. **NOTICE**
        This issue is provided for situational awareness. Planning by operators
        and USSs may be affected.
      6. **INFORMATIONAL**
          This issue is provided for situational awareness.

      Note that this approach leverages RFC 5424: "The Syslog Protocol." By
      taking this approach, there is the possibility of formalizing
      UTMMessaging with more elements of the RFC to allow for compatibility
      with other logging systems. https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424

          an operational system decides on the approach to discovery.

          For Gridded USS Discovery, this should be an x,y,z string where

          traditional discovery, this means the first time you announce to your
          LUN.

          The submit_time value MUST remain constant for each recipient of the announcement
          since this value is potentially part of a signature of the Operation
          plan in some cases.  So, when data (or references to the data) are
          written to the grid, the same data are to be sent, as required, to
          other stakeholders (e.g. other USSs).  This means that if there is a
          500ms difference in the time that you send and get confirmation from
          the grid, you DO NOT update the submit_time when sending to the USSs
          after that.
          When the operation is announced for the first time, update_time MUST be equal to submit_time.
          When an operation is modified (updated), update_time MUST be greater than submit_time.

          Similarly, for traditional discovery, if there is a delay in sending
          the data to one LUN member versus another, this field is NOT updated
          in between as we want each stakeholder to ultimately receive the same

          The current state of the operation.  Must be maintained by the USS.
          Some additional details in the USS Specification.

          0. PROPOSED
            This operation is not yet ACCEPTED.  It may be awaiting information
            from the operator, it may be in conflict with another ACCEPTED or
            ACTIVATED operation and undergoing a negotiation process, or for
            some other reason it is not yet able to be declared ACCEPTED.
          1. ACCEPTED
            This operation has been deemed ACCEPTED by the supporting USS. This
            implies that the operation meets the requirements for operating in
            the airspace based on the type of operation submitted.
          2. ACTIVATED
            This operation is active. The transition from ACCEPTED to ACTIVATED
            is not an announced transition. The transition is implied based on
            the submitted start time of the operation (i.e. the
            effective_time_begin of the first OperationVolume). Note that an
            ACTIVATED operation is not necessarily airborne, but is assumed
            to be "using" the OperationVolumes that it has announced.
          3. CLOSED
            This operation is closed. It is not airborne and will not become
            airborne again. If the UAS and the crew will fly again, it would
            need to be as a new operation. A USS may announce the closure of any
            operation, but is not required to announce unless the operation was
            ROGUE or NONCONFORMING.
          4. NONCONFORMING
            See USS Specification for requirements to transition to this state.
          5. ROGUE
            See USS Specification for requirements to transition to this state.

          If ordering of states is required for any purpose, they shall be
          ordered as follows:
            PROPOSED < ACCEPTED < ACTIVATED < CLOSED < NONCONFORMING < ROGUE

          A note on "intersection":
            Note 2: All of the terms "crosses", "within", "touches" imply
            intersection. I can track down a source for this definition
            (probably OGC), but for now, you can see it illustrated in the
            description for PostGIS intersection:
              https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Intersects.html

          Validation of the array must include the following checks:
            1. The array of operation volumes MUST have minimum length of 1.
            2. The array of operation volumes MUST have maximum length of 250.
            3.  Each operation volume MUST have non-zero 4D volume
              (i.e. each of the 4 dimensions much be > 0 in magnitude).
            4. Volume intersection must pass the following checks:
              a. When ordered by ordinal values, a succeeding operation volume
              must have a 2D or 3D intersection in 3D space with its immediately
              preceding operation volume.  Note that a 2D intersection in 3D
              space implies two volumes that "touch" and the intersection has 2D
              area.  Sharing just an edge would not qualify.  3D volumes that
              don't touch at all would not qualify, even if they would intersect
              when projected into 2D space (e.g. if "looking down" on the two
              volumes).
              b. When ordered by ordinal values, a succeeding operation volume
              must have a non-negative temporal intersection with its
              immediately preceding operation volume (Note we'd calculate this
              by t1-t2 where t1 is the preceding operation volume end time and
              t2 is the succeeding operation volume start time.).
              c. When ordered by ordinal values, a succeeding operation volume
              must have either a non-zero volume (3D) intersection OR a positive
              temporal intersection. (Note this is a logical "OR" so it may have
               both intersection types... i.e. it is not an "exclusive OR").
            5. Each spatial dimension of an op vol's bounding box must have
            length less than 6000ft (should discuss with partners this value).
            This is a sanity check against excessively large volumes. Need to
            be careful here as there may be legitimate use cases wherein large
            volumes are required/allowed, but we want to encourage efficient
            planning and protect against misuse of the shared airspace.
            6. The planned duration of an op vol must be less than 120 minutes. Again,
            need to be careful to not damage legitimate use cases, but need to
            protect against misuse/poor planning. For long duration missions,
            it may be reasonable to have them replan or to have volumes with
            the same geog and long time values that slightly intersect.
            7. The start time of an operation volume other than the first in the
            array must be greater than or equal to the start time of its
            immediately preceding operation volume.
            (note this probalby should be #4 or so, bumping the others down,
            but I didn't want to cause confusion in case implementers are
            referencing these checks somewhere by number.)

            UNPLANNED_LANDING MUST have severity ALERT if any damage or potential damage or injury other than to the UAS itself.  CRITICAL otherwise.
          2. UNCONTROLLED_LANDING
            This operation had an uncontrolled landing either at the originally
            planned landing location or another location.
            UNCONTROLLED_LANDING MUST be sent with severity ALERT if any damage or potential damage or injury other than to the UAS itselft.  CRITICAL otherwise.
          3. OPERATION_NONCONFORMING
            This operation has entered the NONCONFORMING state. Must be sent to
            LUN anytime operation transitions to this state.
            OPERATION_NONCONFORMING MUST be sent with severity ALERT if the operation is expected to intersect another operation plan or unauthorized airspace.
            OPERATION_NONCONFORMING MUST be sent with severity EMERGENCY if already intersecting another operation or if already entered unauthorized airspace. Otherwise CRITICAL.
          4. OPERATION_ROGUE
            This operation has entered the ROGUE state.
            OPERATION_ROGUE MUST be sent anytime operation transitions to ROGUE state.
            OPERATION_ROGUE MUST be sent with severity ALERT if no current or immediate intersection with another operation or unauthorized airspace. EMERGENCY otherwise.
          5. OPERATION_CONFORMING
            This operation was previously in the NONCONFORMING state and has
            transitioned back to the ACTIVE state. 'gufi' field is required with
            this message_type.
          6. OPERATION_CLOSED
            OPERATION_CLOSED MUST be sent when and operation has entered the terminal CLOSED state.
            The operation will not again be active or in flight.
            OPERATION_CLOSED MUST be sent with severity NOTICE if transitioning from ACCEPTED to CLOSED.
            OPERATION_CLOSED MUST be sent with severity CRITICAL if transitioning from NONCONFORMING or ROGUE.
          7. CONTINGENCY_PLAN_INITIATED
            A USS MUST send this message type to its LUN when a Contingency Plan begins.
          8. CONTINGENCY_PLAN_CANCELLED
            A USS MUST send this message type to its LUN when a Contingency Plan ends or changes.
          9. PERIODIC_POSITION_REPORTS_START
            The requestor wants position reports provided for the operation
            referenced in the 'gufi' field of this request. Reports must be
            provided as per the USS Specification.
            PERIODIC_POSITION_REPORTS_START MUST be sent with severity NOTICE.
          10. PERIODIC_POSITION_REPORTS_END
            The requestor wants previously requested position reports to end.
            If this message is received without a corresponding
            PERIODIC_POSITION_REPORTS_START, the message response is TBD (200,
            400, 401, 404, etc.).
            PERIODIC_POSITION_REPORTS_END MUST be sent with severity NOTICE.
          11. UNAUTHORIZED_AIRSPACE_PROXIMITY
            An operation is within 3038 feet (almost 0.5nmi) from the boundary
            of unauthorized airspace (e.g., UVR/TFR, controlled airspace,
            airspace constraint).
            UNAUTHORIZED_AIRSPACE_PROXIMITY MUST be sent with severity WARNING.
          12. UNAUTHORIZED_AIRSPACE_ENTRY
            An operation has breached the boundary and entered into
            unauthorized airspace (e.g., UVR/TFR, controlled airspace, airspace
            constraint).
            UNAUTHORIZED_AIRSPACE_ENTRY MUST be sent with severity CRITICAL.
          13. OTHER_SEE_FREE_TEXT
            Messages that do not fit any of the otherwise defined categories.
            Should be used sparingly or with additional out-of-band description.
            OTHER_SEE_FREE_TEXT severity MUST be INFORMATIONAL or ALERT.
            Only use ALERT if there
            is some risk of injury or damage that would not be captured with
            any of the other enums.

          The following table summarizes the appropriate message_type-severity
          combinations.  If a combination is not in the table, then it is not
          an allowable combination and must not be used within the USS Network.

          A base URL used by the USS Discovery Service and other USS Instances
          to callback to the USS Instance.
          USS Discovery will append "/uss" to the base URL in order to PUT a
          new uss_instance to the USS Instance. It will also do the same to test
          the URL when it first receives a uss_instance.
          USS Instances and other clients/services will append "/operations" to
          the base URL in order to share operations. Similarly with
          "/utm_messages", "/negotiations", etc.
          The base URL will also be used in obtaining the websocket for position
          sharing.
          This URL may be unique to the USS Instance or may be shared by other
          USS Instances created by the same USS.  URLs that are common to
          multiple USS Instances will receive only one callback.
