      The set of scopes used in UTM OAuth 2.0 implementation. Scopes take the form of <namespace>_<operation>.<object> where "operation" is the type of permission (read/write, etc.) and "object" is the type of thing the action is performed upon. A "write" action should be assumed to all read access to the subject as well as writing. The namespace may aid in deconfliction and clarity of scopes. Terms conform to INCITS 359.

  # Labels taken from RFC 5424
  severity:
    description: >-
      The severity level of a UTMMessage. This severity labeling may be used by other components within UTM as well.  The labels are ordered such that they may be given priority handling by software systems and human users.
      
      **EMERGENCY > ALERT > CRITICAL > WARNING > NOTICE > INFORMATIONAL**
      
      In relation to a UTMMessage, the severities may be interpreted as follows.
      
      1. **EMERGENCY**
        There is an **immediate** impact to the safety of other air operations, the safety of people, or the safety of structures on the ground. Actions to mitigate required by other operations.
      2. **ALERT**
        There may be an impact to the safety of other air operations, the safety of people, or the safety of structures on the ground. Actions to mitigate required by other operations.
      3. **CRITICAL**
        Without mitigations by the affected operation, the situation may rise to an emergency in the near future.
      4. **WARNING**
        There is a contained issue that may result in the loss of aircraft. No immediate or likely effect to other operations, people on the ground, or structures.
      5. **NOTICE**
        This issue is provided for situational awareness. Planning by operators and USSs may be affected.
      6. **INFORMATIONAL**
        This issue is provided for situational awareness.

          The current state of the operation.  Must be maintained by the USS. Some additional details in the USS Specification.
          
          1. ACCEPTED
            This operation has been deemed ACCEPTED by the supporting USS. This implies that the operation meets the requirements for operating in the airspace based on the type of operation submitted.
          2. ACTIVATED
            This operation is active. The transition from ACCEPTED to ACTIVATED is not an announced transition. The transition is implied based on the submitted start time of the operation (i.e. the effective_time_begin of the first OperationVolume). Note that an ACTIVATED operation is not necessarily airborne, but is assumed to be "using" the OperationVolumes that it has announced.
          3. CLOSED
            This operation is closed. It is not airborne and will not become airborne again. If the UAS and the crew will fly again, it would need to be as a new operation. A USS may announce the closure of any operation, but is not required to announce unless the operation was ROGUE or NONCONFORMING.
          4. NONCONFORMING
            See USS Specification for requirements to transition to this state.
          5. ROGUE
            See USS Specification for requirements to transition to this state.

For example, one Contingency may be significantly further from the operation at a given time and, thus, would be less preferred than it might be otherwise.
