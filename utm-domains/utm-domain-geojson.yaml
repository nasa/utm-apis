#Edits by joseph.rios@nasa.gov:
#
#Converted into a domain versus an API.
#Fixed "Point2d" syntax errors
#Removed responses section.
#Removed non-geojson definitions
#Commented out unsupported elements in UTM (multi*, GeometryCollection)
#Updated externalDocs links to point to RFC
#Improved "description" fields.
#issmith1 trying github push , switch to yaml 
#retrying github push to nasa repo.
#issmith1 test whether collaborator can push to Git via API Key
#jlrios: "Point2d" rendering, renamed as "Position" to align with GeoJSON spec.
#jlrios: flattened by removing Geometry to improve codegen, simplify schema
