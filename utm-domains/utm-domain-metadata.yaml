          Expected values: a call sign, test card role, or flight ID that links this operation to a particular test card flight. As an example, in our TCL2 demo, "GCS3" could have been used here. For multiple flights emanating from one location on a test card, this data element could include further information to link the operation to the test card flight, such as GCS1A.
